        <h2>Black Remigration</h2>

        <p>The conversation of Remigration has been brewing 
            in American taverns as of late. The burden, often 
            referred to as “Black Fatigue”, which the vast majority 
            of Americans feel toward this one particular race can 
            be relieved with this one simple policy.
        </p>
        <p>The cost of remigrating our Black population would 
            be far less than the toll they cost our infrastructure and 
            culture. We could start by offering them free tickets along 
            with a one-time payment to help them assimilate in their 
            motherland. We would offer them a period of a few months to 
            vacate our nation after which a policy of forceful deportation 
            would be enacted.
        </p>
        <p>As anyone can see from the data I’ve assembled for the county 
            of Los Angeles, Remigration is a policy which Angelenos would 
            benefit from. The relief would be both cultural and economic. 
            Our communities would be safer.
        </p>
        <p>When first imported, Blacks were farm equipment. Early Americans 
            could never imagine that we would integrate them as citizens. 
            Post emancipation, Blacks find themselves lost in a white mans 
            world. They find it difficult to integrate and to this day live 
            on the fringes of our economy. It is inhumane to do this to them. 
            They deserve all the freedom their motherland offers them.
        </p>
        <p>Remigration would be a relatively radical departure from 
            our recent political history and would receive some backlash 
            at first. However, soon the rewards would become apparent. 
            Other races such as the northern and eastern Asian races 
            integrate into Angeleno and American culture quite well. 
            Imagine having the freedom to live in a clean country unburdened 
            by incompatible foreign elements.
