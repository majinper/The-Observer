        <h2>A Haunting in The Hills</h2>

        <p>I recently watched Louis Rossmann’s “Don’t live with 
            an employee’s mindset; create life as you want it to be.” 
            Louis explains to the viewer the difference in mindset 
            between people who when faced with hardship simply 
            accept the situation and suffering, and people who 
            decide that they want to change the situation for 
            the better.
        </p>
        <p>I visited the community of Val Verde to discover 
            the truth surrounding the stories of a burning landfill 
            choking the life out of residents. What I found while 
            knocking on doors was an example in the ideology of 
            Louis Rossmann. 
        </p>
        <p>While on the road to the Santa Clarita area from the 
            city I noticed a chemical taste in my mouth. While 
            driving up the road toward Val Verde I saw the white 
            tarps covering the hillside. When I finally stepped 
            out into the air, I smelled it, the unmistakable 
            stench of Hydrogen Sulfide. It smells like rotten 
            eggs. And these people just live in it.
        </p>
        <p>While serving in our Navy, I was trained to recognize 
            this gas. I was trained to immediately exit any 
            space in which I thought this gas might be present 
            because 3 breaths would be enough to kill me.
        </p>
        <p>I wondered what could be done about this issue. 
            I’m not a hazmat or landfill expert by any means. 
            I decided to query some townsfolk to gain some sense 
            of what it was like to live there. Of the dozen 
            families who agreed to speak with me, exactly half of 
            them reported that they were suffering from health 
            complications which they directly attributed to the 
            incident at the landfill. Some seemed quite pro-active 
            in wanting to have something done to remedy the 
            situation while others merely described it as something 
            to bear. 
        </p>
        <p>I spoke with one man who had made the trip out 
            to our States capital to lobby for some government 
            assistance. Another man expressed his belief that 
            if only the authorities responsible were motivated, 
            this situation could be fixed. In reading on the 
            subject from other outlets I gained the impression 
            that the authorities seemed to be pushing the blame 
            around, worried more about who would have to pay 
            than the lives of the affected residents. 
        </p>
        <p>Among the reported health complications were headaches, 
            dizziness, watery/burning eyes, skin sensitivity, 
            a constant runny nose, and of course the infamous 
            streak of cancer. It isn’t only H2S creeping through 
            this neighborhood, but other chemicals as well. H2S 
            is a product of decaying biomatter but a resident 
            told me that he knows of a shady past of the landfill. 
            He claimed that in the years before the shutdown, 
            this landfill played host to waste which other 
            landfills wouldn’t touch including discarded computer 
            PCB’s and even nuclear waste. The chemical stench in 
            the air seemed to agree.
        </p>
        <p>Overall, I saw a community stricken by hardship but 
            holding on to hope. Hope that something could finally 
            be done to put this issue to rest for good. Some 
            efforts have been made including closing the landfill 
            and covering the area with tarps to prevent gases 
            from seeping out. Through it all I saw a strong 
            people who believed in family cookouts during the 
            lulls in the stench. I hope that my visit can bring 
            these people one step closer to closure.
        </p>
