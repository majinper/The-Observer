        <h2>Dangerous Rhetoric on Full and Shameless Display</h2><br>

        <p>Communists always enjoy dividing their propagandized victims
             into separate groups, only to promise them that their ills will be alieved 
             should they just submit to their will. We saw this again today in Down Town Los Angeles. 
             Communist organizers took the opportunity to claim for themselves the National 
             Socialist holiday of May Day, the Workers Holiday.
        </p>
        <p>Dangerous rhetoric echoed through loud speakers at little children who only
             wished to be left alone. They boomed on about how they would seize power so that
              they could end as many lives as possible before NatSoc’s could intervene. I met up
               with some Latino organizers who were staged a couple blocks away. I got a few
                pictures of their hateful insignias. I then moved myself toward the main 
                event and my heart sank.
        </p>
        <p>There I saw a few people. I saw a stage surrounded by cameras, no
             doubt paid to spread the communist genocidal nonsense. I saw people
              dressed as furries and some others playing with parachutes. (Please
               see attached YouTube video and photos.) 
        </p>
        <p>The danger that this poses to our societies is inversely correlated
             to the small minority of attendees at this event. In fact the more
              minor, the more radical their positions seem to become. This might
               be a good thing. This might lose them what public support they might
                have once had. Or this might be a warning. What are they planning for
                 when they call for millions of heads to roll down every street? What
                  are they calling for when they label anyone who doesn’t march in step
                   as a traitor to their movement?
        </p>
        <p>Can any place be safe with these despots around? I suspect not. We
             have heard of leftist school shooters. Now imagine leftist school
              shooter hordes in every school. Imagine leftist corruption infiltrating
               every level of government. 
        </p>
        <p>These demonstrations serve as a warning and rallying call for those who see
             past communist propagandist lies.
